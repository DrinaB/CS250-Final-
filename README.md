### 1. **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
   - **Interpreting User Needs**: To effectively meet user requirements, I focus on understanding the specific goals and pain points of the users. I translate these needs into functional requirements, which form the basis of the program’s features and workflows.
   - **Creating User Stories**: User stories are short, descriptive statements that outline what the user wants to accomplish. By framing features as user stories (e.g., “As a user, I want to save my progress so that I can resume my game later”), I can prioritize essential features and ensure the software aligns with user expectations. User stories also guide the development process, helping keep the user experience at the forefront of each feature I implement.

### 2. **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
   - I take a structured, iterative approach to program development, focusing on breaking down large tasks into manageable components. Starting with requirement analysis and design planning, I create a roadmap that guides coding, testing, and refining each feature.
   - **Agile Processes for Future Development**:
     - **Daily Standups**: Regular check-ins to align with team progress and address any roadblocks.
     - **Sprint Planning**: Defining clear goals for each sprint to maintain focus and prioritize key features.
     - **Retrospectives**: Reflecting on what went well and areas for improvement at the end of each sprint, which supports continuous learning and process enhancement.
     - **Continuous Integration**: Automating testing and integrating code frequently to ensure quality and maintain momentum.

### 3. **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
   - Being a good team member means actively contributing to team goals while supporting others. This includes clear communication, respect for diverse viewpoints, and a willingness to help resolve challenges that arise during development. I aim to bring a positive, collaborative attitude, stay open to feedback, and prioritize the success of the team over individual accomplishments. By fostering trust and open communication, I contribute to an environment where each team member can thrive and produce high-quality work.
